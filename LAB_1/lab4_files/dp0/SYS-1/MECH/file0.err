/COM,ANSYS RELEASE Release 19.2      BUILD 19.2      UP20180808       23:55:25

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.453   TIME= 23:55:30
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.672   TIME= 23:55:30
 Material number 5 (used by element 46967) should normally have at least 
 one MP or one TB type command associated with it.  Output of energy by  
 material may not be available.                                          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.938   TIME= 23:55:31
 Maximum contact stiffness 1.6E+16 is too big which can cause an         
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      10.234   TIME= 23:55:53
 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 out-of-core memory mode.  This memory mode may provide significantly    
 worse performance compared to the in-core memory mode, depending on     
 the amount of available system memory and I/O speed.  Please monitor    
 the solver performance to ensure that the large amount of I/O to the    
 solver files does not create a bottleneck for performance.              

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      40.812   TIME= 23:58:59
 During this session the elapsed time exceeds the CPU time by 451%.      
 Often this indicates either a lack of physical memory (RAM) required    
 to efficiently handle this simulation or it indicates a particularly    
 slow hard drive configuration.  This simulation can be expected to run  
 faster on identical hardware if additional RAM or a faster hard drive   
 configuration is made available.  For more details, please see the      
 ANSYS Performance Guide which is part of the ANSYS Help system.
